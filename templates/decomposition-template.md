## Decomposition Principles

- Each task should be independently verifiable (has its own acceptance criteria)
- Each task should be small enough to complete in 1-2 days
- Tasks should be ordered so each one builds on the previous
- Each task should produce a working increment (no "part 1 of 3" that doesn't work alone)
